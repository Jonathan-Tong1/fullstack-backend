# fullstack-backend

This repository contains the backend section of a full-stack web application built with Spring Boot, React, and SQL. The backend is responsible for data processing, business logic, and interaction with the database using JPA Hibernate for seamless and efficient data persistence.

## Features
Spring Boot: The backend is powered by Spring Boot, a framework that simplifies the development of robust and scalable Java-based applications.

JPA Hibernate: For database interaction, the project utilizes Java Persistence API (JPA) with Hibernate as the implementation. This ensures a straightforward and object-relational mapping approach.

SQL Database: The application is designed to work with a SQL database, offering a reliable and structured way to store and retrieve data.
